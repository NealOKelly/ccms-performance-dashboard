          <p class="govuk-body">This page shows data collected supplied by LAA's Digital DBA team as part of their daily checks. An <a href="tools/brm-data-transformation-tool.xlsm">Excel Macro</a> is used to transform the data, after which it manually uploaded to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUcd_R_vnJDtSNlkrSGsvcJe-bKd8lDqJALeDAKEYpA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What does it measure?</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">The Business Rules Monitor controls the workflow within CCMS.  There are numerous jobs orchestrated by the Business Rules Monitor.  The chart delay data relating to a specific job &mdash; App Review.  App Review was chosen as are it has quite long execution times, so any variability in its performance will be more easily observable than most other jobs.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why does it matter?</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">The performance of the Business Rules Monitor can be thought of as a proxy indicator for overall system performance. Longer runtimes might mean a degradation in performance (or &mdash; alternatively &mdash; an increase in workload).</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Although, these are background processes, there may be direct end user impacts of an increase in runtimes &mdash; providers and caseworkers may have to wait longer for system processes to complete before they can move on to their next task.</p>
