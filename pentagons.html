          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the data</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">This page shows data collected supplied by Capgemini as part of their daily checks</a>. These data a generated at part of the 'Report Set' which is run overnight.  They are manually uploaded to <a class="govuk-link" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUcd_R_vnJDtSNlkrSGsvcJe-bKd8lDqJALeDAKEYpA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>. As such, the charts below may not reflect the current network performance.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Note that Capgemini do not supply daily check data on non-working days.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">The date supplied is the Report Date. The average runtime figures reported relate to the 24 hour period immediate prior to the Report Set being run.</p>

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What does it measure?</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">The batch schedule orchestrates batch processing in CCMS. There are a number of batch processing jobs that are run continuously (on loop) within CCMS.  These are: </p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Continuous Background Set 1</li>
          <li>Continuous Background Set 2</li>
          <li>Continuous Background Set 3</li>
          <li>Provider Synchronisation</li>
        </ul>
          <p class="govuk-body">These data show the average runtime of each of those jobs.</p>
          <hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why does it matter?</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">The performance of the batch schedule can be thought of as a proxy indicator for overall system performance. Longer runtimes might mean a degradation in performance (or &mdash; alternatively &mdash; an increase in workload).</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Although, these are background processes, there may be direct end user impacts of an increase in runtimes &mdash; providers and caseworkers may have to wait longer for system processes to complete before they can move on to their next task.</p>
