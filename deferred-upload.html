          <p class="govuk-body">These data are supplied by Capgemini as part of their daily checks. They are derived by manually executing a query.  The actual time the query is executed may vary.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">These data are held in - and can be edited using - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUcd_R_vnJDtSNlkrSGsvcJe-bKd8lDqJALeDAKEYpA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>.</p>

		  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What does it measure?</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">Documents generated by CCMS &mdash; or uploaded via the PUI (Provider User Interface) &mdash; are cached within the CCMS eBusiness Suite database pending upload to the Northgate Electronic Document and Records Management System. This page shows data relating to the number of documents pending upload to Northgate.</p>

		  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why does it matter?</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">Documents held in cache can cause uneccessary growth of the CCMS eBusiness Suite database.  This has the potential to adversely affect the performance of the wider system.  It also increases the time taken to complete a back-up of the system.</p>
